    "What are the main challenges of federated learning?": "Heterogeneity between the different local datasets: each node may have some bias with respect to the general population, and the size of the datasets may vary significantly; Temporal heterogeneity: each local dataset's distribution may vary with time; Interoperability of each node's dataset is a prerequisite; Each node's dataset may require regular curations; Hiding training data might allow attackers to inject backdoors into the global model; Lack of access to global training data makes it harder to identify unwanted biases entering the training e.g. age, gender, sexual orientation; Partial or total loss of model updates due to node failures affecting the global model; Lack of annotations or labels on the client side. Heterogeneity between processing platforms",
    "Explain how federated learning differs from traditional centralized training.": "The main difference between federated learning and distributed learning lies in the assumptions made on the properties of the local datasets, as distributed learning originally aims at parallelizing computing power where federated learning originally aims at training on heterogeneous datasets.",
    "Why is data heterogeneity a problem in federated learning?": "Because client data is decentralized, data samples held by each client may not be independently and identically distributed",
    "How does federated learning address privacy concerns?": "by training algorithms collaboratively without exchanging the data itself"
