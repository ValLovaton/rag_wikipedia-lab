(2014) and Smith et al. (2017), to the case where both samples and features are partitioned across clients. HyFDCA claims several improvement over existing algorithms: HyFDCA is a provably convergent primal-dual algorithm for hybrid FL in at least the following settings. Hybrid Federated Setting with Complete Client Participation Horizontal Federated Setting with Random Subsets of Available Clients The authors show HyFDCA enjoys a convergence rate of O(1\\u2044t) which matches the convergence rate of FedAvg (see below). Vertical Federated Setting with Incomplete Client Participation The authors show HyFDCA enjoys a convergence rate of O(log(t)\\u2044t) whereas FedBCD exhibits a slower O(1\\u2044sqrt(t)) convergence rate and requires full client participation. HyFDCA provides the privacy steps that ensure privacy of client data in the primal-dual setting. These principles apply to future efforts in developing primal-dual algorithms for FL. HyFDCA empirically outperforms HyFEM and FedAvg in loss function value and validation accuracy across a multitude of problem settings and datasets (see below for more details). The authors also introduce a hyperparameter selection framework for FL with competing metrics using ideas from multiobjective optimization. There is only one other algorithm that focuses on hybrid FL, HyFEM proposed by Zhang et al. (2020). This algorithm uses a feature matching formulation that balances clients building accurate local models and the server learning an accurate global model. This requires a matching regularizer constant that must be tuned based on user goals and results in disparate local and global models. Furthermore, the convergence results provided for HyFEM only prove convergence of the matching formulation not of the original global problem. This work is substantially different than HyFDCA's approach which uses data on local clients to build a global model that converges to the same solution as if the model was trained centrally. Furthermore, the local and\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A defining characteristic of federated learning is data heterogeneity. Because client data is decentralized, data samples held by each client may not be independently and identically distributed. Federated learning is generally concerned with and motivated by issues such as data privacy, data minimization, and data access rights. Its applications involve a variety of research areas including defence, telecommunications, the Internet of things, and pharmaceuticals.'"
